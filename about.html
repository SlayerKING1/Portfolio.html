<h3 draggable="true"><u>Things i dont like:</u></h3>
<ul type="square">
    <li>I hate crowdy places such as clubs,parties,etc not because i dont like interaction, i do but limited .</li>
    <li>I dont like having conversation that are too long but its situational haha</li>
    <li>I hate when i cant express what i am feeling, also it feels burdensome...</li>
</ul>
<P>I am surprised as to how difficult it is to write about things i hate,<br>but if i had to say something then it would be waiting for chapters for the manwhas i am reading lol :)</P>
